### Tips

Command line arguments are strings of text used to pass additional information to a program when an application is run through the CLI. Some benefits for using command line arguments include the following:
* You can pass information to an application before it starts. This is particularly useful if you want to perform large number configuration settings.
* Command line arguments are passed as strings to your program. String data types can easily be converted to other data types within an application, making the arguments very flexible.
* You can pass unlimited number of arguments via the command line.
* Command line arguments are used in conjunction with scripts and batch files, which is particularly useful for automated testing.
